### About
My name is Arielle Herman, and I am an MA/MPA candidate in a dual-master's degree program studying applied statistics at [Quantitative Methods for Social Sciences](http://www.qmss.columbia.edu/) and economic and political development at [School of International and Public Affairs](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/) of Columbia University.  For my data science MA thesis, I compared COVID-19 related posts across social media platforms using Bayesian analysis.  For my capstone project at SIPA, I lead my team in structuring a dataset to capture the impact of humanitarian crises over time for the Risk Analysis and Preparedness Section of [UNICEF EMOPS](https://www.unicef.org/appeals/global-support). I have an undergraduate background in Economics and Philosophy, and I am excited to apply quantitative and qualitative tools to the study of human behavior.  I am currently working as a part-time research assistant at [Columbia Communities Speak](https://www.communitiesspeakproject.com/) and I am resposible for the data cleaning and validation, and contribute to the survey question creation and data analysis.  You can see some of my previous projects [here](https://github.com/aeherman/hello-world).

Please feel free to reach me at **a.herman@columbia.edu**.

Fun fact(s): I love to read, play music (especially the concert harp!), and lindy hop in my free time.
